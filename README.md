# TUM Campus App for Android
### ðŸš¨ Public Service Announcement ðŸš¨
Due to the lack of a main maintainer and the need to revise major parts of the app to adapt it to the latest versions of Android, this app will soon become obsolete. This will probably happen sometime in 2024.

You are still welcome to contribute to this app, and who knows, maybe we will find someone willing to take over the maintenance.

All further development will focus on our [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)-based alternative, hosted here: [github.com/TUM-Dev/Campus-Flutter](https://github.com/TUM-Dev/Campus-Flutter)

### An Excellent App for Students by Students
The TUM Campus App (TCA) is an open source project, which is mainly developed by volunteers with significant contributions by the Android Practical course. The TCA mostly targets phones, but can also be used on tablets or any Android device.

## Features:
- Lecture calendar (with in-app view and a syncing service to the device's calendar)
- Meal plans of various cafeterias (Studentenwerk MÃ¼nchen)
- View all your grades
- Find empty study rooms
- MVV departure times
- TUM and related News (mostly in German)
- Roomfinder
- Automatic muting while lectures are held
- Available in English and German
